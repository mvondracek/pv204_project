# Contributing

You are welcomed to contribute :)
Below, you can find a few options on how to.

### 1. Improving and testing the JCMathLib code
Please discuss the intended change via [Issues](https://github.com/OpenCryptoProject/JCMathLib/issues), then make a Pull request, please.

### 2. Supporting us with smartcards, we don't have yet
It is difficult to obtain the latest versions of smartcards with ECC support in small quantities. If you can send us a few pieces for development and testing, we are happy to list you as [JCMathLib supporters](https://github.com/OpenCryptoProject/JCMathLib/blob/master/README.md#Project-supporters). Many thanks to all that already did! 

### 3. Spreading the word about JCMathLib library
Help us to make the JavaCard platform more open and creative. Use JCMathLib, tell others, release your prototype with proprietary API calls substitued by JCMathLib and let us know (we are happy to include you in the list of [JCMathLib users](https://github.com/OpenCryptoProject/JCMathLib/blob/master/README.md#Happy-users-so-far).
